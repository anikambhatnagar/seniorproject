week 9:
This week we solidified the features we want in our app, as well as how we want the UI flow to look. We made some changes to our initial proposal for the app, since we decided to stray away from the financiual advising app idea. We documented our new app ideas and details in the SDP, and all refreshed ourselves on app development practices and tools such as Swift, firebase, cocoapods, camera integration.

week 11:
We've been working on implementing the camera functionality for Momento, focusing on enabling smooth photo capture for daily entries. Integration with iOS photo suggestions from the Camera Roll is in progress to allow users to document moments with ease. Progress has been steady, with continued testing to ensure a seamless photo upload experience within the app.
