week 9:
This week we solidified the features we want in our app, as well as how we want the UI flow to look. We made some changes to our initial proposal for the app, since we decided to stray away from the financiual advising app idea. We documented our new app ideas and details in the SDP, and all refreshed ourselves on app development practices and tools such as Swift, firebase, cocoapods, camera integration.
